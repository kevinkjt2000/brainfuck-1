# brainfuck

This repo contains brainfuck (bf from now on) intrepreters. 
The intention is to write an intrepreter in a few languages so they can be compared and contrasted.
The goal for all intrepreters is to mirror at least what bf.cpp can do.
At the moment it can:  
- read a program from stdin, accept the eof to terminate program input and execute the input program( with input accepted by intrepreted program )  
- Read a program from a file given as a command line argument, and give it full access to stdin.
- Read multiple programs in from files and execute them all storing their output in another file. No input is avaliable to the bf programs.
